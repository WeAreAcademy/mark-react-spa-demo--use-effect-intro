You've been using React's `useState` hook - which is by far the most common and most important out of the React hooks. Now, we'll look at `useEffect`, which ranks #2 on that list.

## Learning Outcomes

- Predict when a `useEffect`'s callback will run
- Explain the role of `useEffect` dependency array

## Navigating the demo

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** You can explain the `console.log`s that appear in the browser console

You'll see in the demo that `useEffect` takes two arguments:

1. A callback function
2. An array

Here's roughly how `useEffect` works:

1. On every render of the component, it checks the values in its the dependency array
2. If _any_ of the values in the array have changed since the last render, then `useEffect` executes its callback
